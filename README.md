This repository is a collection of three distinct machine learning projects, demonstrating a range of skills in data analysis, model development, and predictive modeling.

1.  Property Price Prediction
This project focuses on predicting property prices in California using simple and multiple linear regression. It analyzes features like income and location to build a model that accurately estimates house values.

2.  Customer Churn Prediction
This project addresses customer churn by building a classification model to predict which customers are at high risk of leaving. The model uses demographic and service data to provide insights for proactive retention strategies.

3.  Early Disease Detection
This project uses patient health and demographic data to build a classification model for the early detection of heart disease. It involves extensive data preprocessing and a comparison of several models to find the most accurate one.
